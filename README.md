## 🎯 Overview

Neurowellness Healthcare Platform is a production-ready, enterprise-scale frontend application designed to support healthcare workflows for patients, clinicians, reviewers, and administrators.

### Key Features

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Modular, feature-driven architecture
- Strict TypeScript and schema validation (Zod)
- Clear separation between UI, business logic and data
- React Query for server state and caching
- Zustand for global UI state
- Tailwind CSS for styling

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

We follow enterprise-grade principles: separation of concerns, feature-driven structure, and type-safety. UI components are presentation-only, business logic lives in hooks/services, and a centralized API layer handles all HTTP communication.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- React 18+
- TypeScript 5.x (strict)
- TanStack Query (React Query)
- Zustand (UI state)
- React Hook Form
- Tailwind CSS
- Zod, Axios, date-fns
- ESLint, Prettier

---

```

Refer to the in-repo files for detailed organization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.17.0
- npm >= 9.0.0

Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "NEUROWELLNESS Frontend/NEUROWELLNESS-CRM" # or your cloned folder
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API URL and settings
```

Development

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

Build & Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

Common commands:

```bash
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
npm test
```

---

## 🗄️ State Management Strategy

We use a 3-layer state model:

1. Server state — React Query (API data, caching)
2. Global UI state — Zustand (sidebar, theme, modals, toasts)
3. Local component state — useState for ephemeral UI

Keep API data out of global UI stores.

---

## 🌐 API Layer Architecture

All API calls go through `lib/api/` (Axios instance + services). Use service methods in hooks and components should consume hooks (React Query) rather than calling Axios directly.

Example service pattern:

```ts
export const patientService = {
  getAll: (params) => api.get('/patients', { params }),
  getById: (id) => api.get(`/patients/${id}`),
  create: (data) => api.post('/patients', data),
  update: (id, data) => api.patch(`/patients/${id}`, data),
  delete: (id) => api.delete(`/patients/${id}`),
};
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- Tokens: prefer httpOnly cookies for JWTs
- Automatic refresh via Axios interceptors
- Route protection implemented in `middleware.ts`

---

## 📂 Folder Organization

Features are self-contained under `features/<name>/` with `components/`, `hooks/`, and `types/`. Follow the existing pattern when adding new features.

---

## 📏 Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Explicit return types for public functions
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `useXxx.ts`
- Keep components presentational; put logic in hooks/services

---

## 🐳 Deployment

Example Docker workflow:

```bash
docker build -t neurowellness-frontend .
docker run -p 3000:3000 neurowellness-frontend
```

Production checklist: envs configured, endpoints verified, monitoring enabled.
